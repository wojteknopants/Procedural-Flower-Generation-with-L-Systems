# Procedural-Flower-Generation-with-L-Systems
Developed a Python application as the final project for the Python for Engineering course at university. This application uses L-Systems to procedurally generate a plant, namely L-Py, and PlantGL libraries to generate 3D models of Vinca major Variegata flower.
